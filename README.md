# my-vim-config
My personal configuration on Vim and plugins

At this configuration module, I'm using some plugins to improve my interface and usability of Vim on my computer

- vim-startify
- awesome-vim-colorschemes
- indentLine
- nerdtree
- vim-devicons

You'll need to make a path to clone these repositories (Linux) :
~/.vim/pack/git-plugins/start/
